        <p>My name is Clifford Aduako Donkor.I am Eighteen(18)years of age.I was born and raised in Agona Odobeng,Central Region.<br>
            Growing up in Agona Odoben,I was surrounded by a close-knit community and a supportive family that instilled in me values<br>
             of kindness,perseverance,and curiosity.My parents,Mr. and Mrs. Donkor, always emphasized the importance of education and <br>
             hardwork,and these principles have been the cornerstone of my journey.My academic journey began at Christ Union Academy,<br>
             where I discovered my passion for learning. I was particularly drawn to Maths and Science, which opened my eyes to new <br>
             ideas and perspectives. As I progressed to Presec,Legon and currently,UMaT,I continue to excel.Looking ahead, I am excited<br>
             about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead. My aspiration is to rise up in the Tech industry. I am currently <br>
             working towards this goal and I am committed to continuouslearning and personal growth. My dream is to make a meaningful<br>
             contribution to Tech Industry, leveraging my skills and experiences to create positive change.
